Klasifikasi data KNN mengambil sekelompok data dengan fitur yang mirip dan mengklasifikasikannya ke dalam kelas atau label yang sama.\n","\n","Dalam KNN, setiap data pada dasarnya diwakili sebagai sebuah titik dalam ruang fitur multidimensi. Ketika KNN melakukan klasifikasi data baru, ia akan mencari sekelompok tetangga terdekat dari data baru tersebut dalam ruang fitur tersebut. KNN kemudian mengambil mayoritas label dari tetangga terdekat sebagai label yang akan diberikan pada data baru tersebut. Oleh karena itu, KNN disebut sebagai metode \"lazy learning\" karena tidak memerlukan proses pelatihan yang kompleks seperti halnya dengan metode pembelajaran mesin yang lainnya."],"metadata":{"id":"NsuvV6QRVByD"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Langkah 1**\n","\n","Import library yang diperlukan (pandas, numpy,
